OLPCGames 1.6

    * Provide File-reading/writing request functionality
    * Provide ability to block the GTK event loop for particular 
        operations which GTK expects to be synchronous calls
        but which we have to process asynchronously via the 
        Pygame eventwrap queue.

OLPCGames 1.5

    * require explicit imports of sub-modules
    * reduce "novelty" of the eventwrap module to more closely match
        the pygame.event interface, adds event-type-filtering, eliminates
        the extra function for querying the time-since-last-event 
    * pausescreen now tracks time-since-last-event itself
    * move the manifest-building script into olpcgames directory

OLPCGames 1.4

    * provide pause-screen functionality for reducing system load 
    * Get overlay video (i.e. video in a window over your pygame window)
        working.  Caused change in the base class for PygameCanvas
    * make the global "widget" follow naming conventions, now "WIDGET"
    * explicitly log top-level errors in the pygame loop for developers
    * use mock/synthetic events for all Pygame event-loop events (work 
        around issues with older Pygame versions)
    * add underline support to pango font

	  an integer, rather than as a unicode string value
	* Minor docstring fixes

OLPCGames 1.1

    * camera: async api, heavily refactored, adds test source support
    * mesh: modern Telepathy APIs, convenience methods, cleanup
    * pangofont: transparent colors, older pygtk support, test block
    * events: capture remaining pygame events and forward to the new queue
    * activity: auto-sizing, refactored, global reference available
    * fix focus bug after sharing
    * more docstrings throughout
    * absolute imports so we don't run afoul of later Python versions
